# QPocket

## Project Description
QPocket is one of the earliest wallets that support multiple shards by fully supporting QuarkChain(https://quarkchain.io/). It explores a lot on multi-shard workflow to give end-users a more natural way when they need to deal with multiple shards/chains to complete one task. Besides QuarkChain, QPocket also supports Bitcoin, Ethereum, TRON, and dAPP stores that are built on top of those chains. It covers three platforms which are iOS, Android, and Chrome extension.

Polkadot is a true multi-chain application environment and QPocket puts a lot of effort into the multi-shards workflow which can give Polkadot end users a better user experience when they need to deal with multiple chains. Also, QPocket provides some unique wallet features which will give Polkadot users a better wallet experience: 

* Infinite sub wallets under the same mnemonic: Polkadot users only need to back one mnemonic to have infinite Polkadot wallets. 
* Cold wallet: Polkadot users can turn their old phones into hardware wallets in seconds.
* Ledger support: QPocket supports Ledger nano X for multiple chains.

QPocket plans to integrate the relay chain for Kusama and Polkadot at first, then will support governance, staking, and bonding. As the parachains launch soon afterward, QPocket will continually integrate them one by one. QPocket would love to participate in the Polkadot ecosystem deeply by providing the best wallet service and iterating itself by turning users' real needs into new features.

## Development Roadmap

Engineering resource needed:

* 1 iOS developer
* 1 Android developer
* 1 UI designer
* 1 tester
* 1 product manager

### Milestone 1 — Wallet Management — 1 month — $20,000
* Create a Polkadot wallet, import and export the wallet as mnemonic, private key, or key store.
* Infinite Polkadot sub wallets under the same mnemonic.
* Cold wallet support for Polkadot.
* The code will have proper unit-test coverage to ensure functionality and robustness.
* We will provide both inline documentation of the code and a basic tutorial describing how the software can be used and tested.
* We will provide both iOS and Android package to demonstrating its functionality.

### Milestone 2 — Balance and Transaction — 1 month — $20,000
* Show the balance and transaction history for one wallet.
* Token transfer, fee calculation, and tip.
* The code will have proper unit-test coverage to ensure functionality and robustness.
* We will provide both inline documentation of the code and a basic tutorial describing how the software can be used and tested.
* We will provide both iOS and Android package to demonstrating its functionality.

### Milestone 3 — Integration Test — 0.5 month — $10,000
* Make sure both Kusama and Polkadot are supported
* Make sure the quality is good enough to release a new version through an integration test.
* QPocket new version should be available on App Store and Google Play.

## Future Plans
QPocket will support governance, staking, and bonding. As the parachains launch soon afterward (like ChainX and Edgeware), QPocket will continually integrate them one by one. 

## Additional Information
QPocket team applied for QuarkChain grants successfully and built a full-functional QKC wallet as its first supported public chain, then it supported BTC, ETH, and TRON in the following period. QPocket also built a very close partnership with dAPPs in different categories (e.g. Kyber for DEX, Localcrypto for OTC, Axie Infinity for gaming)

QPocket also provides very unique wallet features to let users manage wallets more securely and conveniently:

* Infinite sub wallets under the same mnemonic: Polkadot users only need to back one mnemonic to have infinite Polkadot wallets. 
* Cold wallet: Polkadot users can turn their old phones into hardware wallets in seconds.
* Ledger support: QPocket supports Ledger nano X for multiple chains.
